This Charm can also be used to shield the Solar against other environmental e ects which would warp her mind or body, such as the twisting choral of the demon prince with voice like crystal facets, or the tainted Essence emanating from the intestines of a malfunctioning First Age manse. But be warned: once the Lawgiver is addicted to the Wyld or mutated by twisting energies, this Charm will not discontinue such e ects; it will only prevent her condition from worsening.",

This Charm also does not defend against attacks that might warp her mind or body directly, such as the Wyld-Mind Strike of the Thousand Venoms Mistress, or  at-level changes to her existence caused by alterations to the Loom of Fate."

When struck with a reality-shaping or fate-weaving attack that would permanently alter her mind or body, the Solar’s destiny manifests to override the changes. This Charm does not completely nullify deleterious e ects. Paying this Charm’s cost merely downgrades or slows the e ect. Destiny-Manifesting Method guarantees two things: First, the Solar cannot be immediately changed beyond her ability to represent the character concept implied by the ten prerequisites from which she derived this Charm. Second, no matter how fatal or permanent the e ect may be, fate itself will generate a condition by which the Solar may shatter any curse. This condition is decided by the Storyteller. The Storyteller should also provide the Solar ample time—seasons or even years—to pursue a cure. The Solar is not guaranteed to know the shattering condition of her curse, but characters with appropriate Lore, Medicine, and Occult Charms may be able to aid her in this regard.",
                        "The Solar cannot be changed beyond her ability to represent the character concept implied by the ten prerequisites from which she derived this Charm. This means, literally, that if a Solar daiklave master who derived this Charm from ten Melee Charms is struck by an attack that would have transformed her into a cat, she is instead changed into a feline beastwoman, allowing her to continue to wield daiklaves and, by extension, to continue to function as a person and a Solar, using Charms, channeling Essence, and so on. Likewise, a legendary Solar courtesan struck by a curse that would wither away her beauty, drying her to a crone-like husk, might experience only a slight downgrade to her Appearance—an unprepossessing feature she can conceal, for example. Furthermore, multiple repurchases, stacking repurchases, and the Solar having a higher Essence rating than her attacker can reduce such effects to nothing or almost nothing when such effects should be completely ignored. In these instances, the Storyteller should give the Solar a temporary dice penalty or make her player roll a few damage dice and move on.",
                        "Because there are many different such effects, the Storyteller has ample latitude to interpret the results. When in doubt, the following things should be considered: this Charm exists for the purpose of telling interesting stories. It is boring and disappointing if a Solar is slain by being turned to stone, and it is equally boring if the Solar runs no risk at all from a secret stone touch or granite-imbuing glance. With this Charm she is instead made obdurate; stony patches mar her skin, and her soak increases by three while her Dexterity is reduced by the same. Given seasons unanswered, this condition might worsen and cause her death, but the Solar at least has a chance to break the curse, manifesting her true destiny. Likewise, a character struck with the killing gaze of Balor might instead experience slow, continuous damage to her health track each time she is rolled into battle. Such characters face crushing adversity as a result of these curses, but may also derive interesting Storyteller-approved benefits from them, aside from the opportunity to explore their character in the face of such a deep and transformative crisis.",

However, this Charm does nothing to stop creatures of the Wyld from attacking the Solar, nor will it do anything to change their composition. At the end of an hour, if the Exalt chooses to reactivate this Charm, ignore the Willpower cost."

This Charm occurs in and depends on phases to accomplish such a feat. Wyld-Shaping Technique consists of a dramatic action lasting about a minute, in which the Solar forces her will upon the Wyld, pays the cost of the Charm, and makes an (Intelligence + Lore) roll against a speci ed di culty. Each time she succeeds at this roll, a phase is completed. Some things can be shaped in a single phase. Others require that the Solar continue to use Wyld-Shaping Technique, phase after phase, in order to reach an appropriate phase on which to accomplish her goal. Each time she reaches a new phase and repays the cost of the Charm, her results from the previous phase are dissolved and reshaped.

Wyld-Shaping Technique requires the pure, inchoate resonance of chaos to work; the bordermarches and middlemarches of Creation are too solid to shape. Therefore, the more complex or large a thing the Solar wishes to shape, the deeper into the deep Wyld she needs to go. It would su ce for her to shape a gold ingot at Creation’s rim, but to raise an island of Creation from the Wyld, she would need to travel several miles into chaos.",

It is much easier for her to call forth massive amounts of general land than it is for her to induct very speci c geography, and smaller, more speci c geography is much more dif cult than larger masses of land simply exuded from her formidable unconscious. For non-speci c land, she can create (Essence x10) square miles of land in the  rst phase, and every successive phase multiplies this by three until phase eight. From phase eight and onward, each successive phase adds (Essence x1000) square miles.",

After phase three, non-speci c land will generate at least one additional minor demesne each phase, and any non-speci c land created at phase six or beyond is guaranteed to have a number of major and minor demesnes. The Solar may spend three successes in any phase to roll a single die; success guarantee a demesne forms, with 7s and 8s equaling a minor demesne of appropriate aspect, 9s equaling a major demesne of appropriate aspect, and a 10 equaling a major demesne with an aspect speci ed by the Solar. The Solar may not add more demesnes to a created landmass than she has spent on upgrades to its area (ie, she must spend two extra successes on increasing land size",

In phase seven the area increases as above, at a rate of (Essence x1000) square miles per phase. Increasing square miles in this calculation costs three successes per ten square miles, and the cost of demesne generation is four successes per demesne. With speci c land, the Solar can designate the kind of terrain, resources or lack of them, the kind of climate and the kind of denizens. The Solar may specify the aspect of all minor demesnes created by rolls or those that naturally occur at later phases. At phase six, she can designate the kinds of sentient creatures living in her world, and such creatures will have both positive and negative Intimacies toward her. She has no control over the spirits inducted into her reality, but each that intrudes on her domain at this phase or beyond will automatically have an Intimacy centered on her of the Storyteller’s choosing.",

If successful, she loses all of her roll-generated demesnes and all minor demesnes, and half her land’s area, to shape a legendary demesne. She may then start building land mass again at phase one, using the above rules.",

Extra successes can be used to personalize or specialize such material wealth, giving exquisite, exotic shape and cut to a single diamond or fashioning a number of ingots into jewelry at a rate of two successes per transformation. At phase two, Resources 3 mundane wealth can be created;",

She may then completely obliviate the land and attached demesnes in order to create enough ore to process it into a single mina in phase one. A phase two synthesis lets her turn the approximated magical material into a single bar of the same type of material; a phase three synthesis allows her to create as much as a talent, while a phase four synthesis allows her to create two talents, and so on. It takes approximately  ve talents of a magical material to build a grand daiklave.",

                        "Everything Else: Wyld-Shaping Technique works through a process of conceptual graduation. In order to raise a fortress, the Solar must  rst create land to stand it on. The Solar may create anything within the realm of possibility, her logic, or her know-how by following these basic rules. To create a mighty warship, she must raise a cradle to set it on in phase one, or otherwise must have created a body of water to  oat it in using speci c land. The boat is then created in phase two. The deeper into the phases of speci c land she goes, the more warships she is able to raise in a single phase, so long as she continues to grow the body of water with each successive phase. A Solar who spends the effort and experience points to create an ocean can also raise up an armada on its waters. The creation of land can be foregone in instances where the Solar can conceptualize some other base for beginning her project, such as the cradle for a ship, but the most powerful expressions of Wyld-Shaping Technique work by way of graduating from one concept to the next. It is much easier to create a number of warships by  rst creating the waters they sail upon. This process is reversed in order to build even more insane constructs. To raise up marvels such as golem manufactories, the Solar must catabolize something much more powerful, such as a legendary demesne."

Her player may then make a pronouncement against an ongoing project based on knowledge her studies reveal, creating bonuses for those who act in accordance with her accurate predictions, and penalties for those who go against them. For example, after reading about the patterns of weather, hostile elemental activity and famine in Jiara during the summer months over the last thousand years, she predicts that Mnemon will not attack Jiaran rebels until fall at the earliest, and will instead spend the summer months consolidating her forces while conserving water and gathering resources for a winter campaign.

Under wraps, earth compacts, and acupuncture, a Solar can rebuild the lost tissues of destroyed eyes and missing limbs, and can even aid a target in growing organs that he was born without. Each time the Solar succeeds at the goal number, the malady decreases in intensity. Once it the goal has been met at the Minor level, a condition vanishes. Missing limbs are fully regrown, paralysis victims are able to walk, mutations wither and slough away or become easily operable. Only Derangements remain at the Minor level, though the Solar may continue to treat her patient at the Minor level to keep his symptoms at bay."

Pay the cost of this Charm once and roll the Solar’s (Wits + Occult) against a di culty of the spirit’s Essence. If successful, the spirit is bound on the spot for a number of turns equal to (extra successes + 1), upon which the Solar must roll (Wits + Occult) against the spirit’s Essence to maintain the cage. Each time the Solar succeeds at this contest, the binding e ect is extended as above, but the di culty also increases by one on each subsequent attempt. During this time, the Solar may approach the spirit, but if she moves more than two range bands away from it, the mandala fades and the spirit is freed. An immaterial spirit trapped in the Spirit-Caging Mandala may be perceived by characters who cannot normally see spirits, and may be struck by characters who cannot normally strike immaterial foes. As the spirit is rendered incapable of moving across range bands, spirits trapped in the cage can only attack characters outside the diagram if they have the ability to attack at range, and only then if they are attacked  rst. Foes who enter the mandala at close range are always fair game."

The spirit begins the game with the Solar’s Essence rating and half her total experience, but may only use the most basic spirit Charms until the Storyteller has had su cient time to approve the spirit’s stats, Intimacies, and magic, as determined by the Solar’s player. This spirit is bound to the Solar as a familiar and becomes an applicable target for certain Survival Charms. A spirit created by the Solar is her thrall for a season. She may then choose to keep it as her familiar or release it. Freeing the current familiar allows her to use this Charm again to create a new familiar. If she decides to retain a bond with the original creature, then she keeps it for another season. Each season that comes and goes, she may choose to retain or relinquish her bond with the spirit so that she may attain a new familiar. Otherwise, the spirit remains as her familiar and is in all senses another character, gaining experience points as any character would. Alternately, the Solar may also induct a Fair Folk into the world. In the Wyld, this Charm usually entails the creation of a raksha, but in Creation, where many denizens of the Wyld were bound into place by the elemental fusion of the Poles, the result is bound to be more unpredictable."
